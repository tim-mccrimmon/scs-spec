  Defines the concept of domains in SCS, the 10 prescribed domains that
  production projects MUST include, what each domain covers, and when to
  add additional domains.

  definition:
    what: >
      Domains are organizational categories that group related concerns and
      context. SCS prescribes 10 minimum domains that production projects
      MUST include to ensure comprehensive system coverage.
    purpose: >
      Domains provide a structured way to organize project-tier SCDs, enable
      parallel team development, and ensure no critical concerns are overlooked.
    domain_bundles: >
      Each domain is represented by a domain bundle containing 2+ project-tier SCDs
      that address that domain's concerns.
