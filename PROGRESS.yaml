  notes: >
    MAJOR MILESTONE: All foundational decisions made. The bundle model is now fully specified.
    Key decisions create a coherent system: independent versioning enables team autonomy,
    same validation rules simplifies implementation, cross-bundle relationships enable real-world
    architecture, standard meta-tier creates ecosystem consistency. The container analogy
    (bundle:hipaa:2.3 = specific HIPAA version) makes the model immediately graspable.
    Every level independently versioned creates full audit trail (project v1.2 → bundles → SCDs).
    No blockers remaining - ready to build meta-tier SCDs, relationship spec, and validator Phase 2.
    The Q&A session validated the core design and surfaced important implementation details.

  summary: "4-bundle-type model implemented: schema updated, examples created (Medication Adherence), documentation rewritten. Question #1 answered (bundles ≠ SCDs)."
  focus: "Formalizing bundle structure with 4 types (project, meta, standards, domain) and container model analogy"
  completed_today:
    - "schema/bundles/scd-bundle-schema.json - Added type field (project/meta/standards/domain), versioned bundle refs, conditional validation rules"

      - "Container analogy established: bundles = Docker manifests, SCDs = layers"
      - "Clear separation: bundles are manifests (NOT SCDs), they organize and reference"
      - "Hierarchical imports: Project → (Meta + Standards + Domains)"

      - "Project structure: updated for 4-bundle-type model"
      - "All docs consistent with new model"
  question_1_answer:
    question: "Where should meta-tier and standards-tier SCDs be listed?"
    answer: "In separate bundles (meta-bundle.yaml, standards-bundle.yaml) that are imported by project bundle"
    decision: "Bundles and SCDs are separate document types (container model)"
    rationale: "Like Docker: manifests organize layers but aren't layers themselves"

      - "Create standard meta-tier SCDs if decided (Question #10)"
  notes: >
    Major milestone: Bundle structure formalized with clear 4-type model and container analogy.
    Question #1 resolved definitively - bundles are manifests (NOT SCDs). This clarity cascaded through
    all documentation and examples. Schema now enforces type-specific rules. Medication Adherence
    examples provide concrete reference implementation. Validator will need significant rework to
    handle new bundle types and validation rules. Container analogy makes model immediately
    understandable to developers. Next: answer remaining questions then rebuild validator.

  notes: >
    Major clarity achieved on bundle structure and lifecycle. The hierarchical model (project bundle → domain bundles → SCDs)
    is now clearly documented. Project structure provides concrete conventions teams can follow.
    Validator Phase 1 is production-ready for individual SCD validation.
    Next phase requires architectural decisions on versioning, state tracking, and validation rules.
    All decisions tracked in .private/ with clear priorities and dependencies.
    Project tracker provides complete roadmap preventing loss of context.

  completed_today:
    - "VISION.md - Comprehensive overview capturing full CEDM/SCS value proposition, indemnification argument, multi-AI coordination, autonomic everything"
    - "GOVERNANCE.md - Full governance model with Benevolent Maintainer phase, RFC process (inspired by Rust), version policy, IP/trademark protection"
    - "rfcs/ infrastructure - Created RFC template (0000-template.md) and README with process documentation"
    - "docs/usage-guide.md - Step-by-step guide: creating SCDs, building bundles, relationships, patterns, anti-patterns (complete tutorial)"
    - "docs/validation-workflow.md - 6 levels of validation, CI/CD integration, common errors, checklists, autonomic governance validation"
    - "GO_TO_MARKET_PLAN.md - Detailed 24-month plan with Hybrid Soft Launch strategy, week-by-week tasks, revenue projections"
  next_steps:
    - "Create 2-3 concrete example SCD bundles (healthcare API, e-commerce, internal tool) - Est: 12-15 hours"
    - "Build basic SCD validator tool (schema validation, relationship checking) - Est: 8-12 hours"
    - "Strengthen README.md with value propositions (lead with indemnification/compliance argument) - Est: 2-3 hours"
    - "After above: White paper development (extract from CEDM book + VISION.md) - Month 2"
  notes: >
    Significant progress toward Month 3 soft launch. Core documentation is now professional and complete.
    VISION.md establishes the "why" (AI without structured context is legally indefensible).
    GOVERNANCE.md provides professional open source governance.
    Usage and validation guides make SCS practical and usable.
    GO_TO_MARKET_PLAN.md provides clear roadmap from soft launch → consulting → platform.
    Remaining Month 1 work: examples, validator, README update (~22-30 hours total).
    Strategy confirmed: Open source spec/registry/tools, commercial platform/book/consulting.
    Protection: Trademark SCS/CEDM, be the authority, control registry, stay ahead on commercial tools.

  summary: "Repo split complete; beginning spec hardening toward Draft 0.1."
  focus: "Strengthen Structured Context Specification (Repo: structured-context-spec)"
  next_steps:
    - "Validate tier definitions and boundaries for meta-tier, project-tier, and standards-tier."
    - "Tighten the core model: SCD shape, bundle shape, category taxonomy, identity & references, versioning model, and intent↔SCD↔bundle link semantics."
    - "Rewrite bundle semantics (v0.2) so bundles reference spec version, list SCDs explicitly, define provenance, optionally reference registry artifacts, and include policy/constraint metadata."
    - "Revisit JSON schemas so required/optional fields and structures match the clarified spec wording and bundle definition."
    - "Clarify governance surfaces: describe governance checks, how governance agents operate, which SCDs they consume, and how teams interpret results."
    - "Produce a high-level Spec Overview diagram tying tiers, SCDs, bundles, registry, tools, and reference implementation together."
  notes: >
    Repo split into four repos (spec, registry, reference implementation, tools) is complete.
    Today’s focus is on stabilizing the core specification so it is usable by the team as Draft 0.1.
    Registry population and reference implementation refinement will follow after spec hardening.
