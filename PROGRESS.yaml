# SCS-Spec STATUS CONTEXT (Do Not Remove This Header)
# =====================================================================
# This file provides a machine-readable snapshot of the project's
# current state, priorities, and focus. It is updated continuously.
#
# Update Rules:
#   1. ALWAYS add new updates at the TOP of the file.
#   2. NEVER rewrite or reorder older entries—append downward.
#   3. Keep summaries concise, factual, and oriented to action.
#   4. Agents should treat the topmost block as authoritative.
#
# Purpose:
#   - Provide a single source of truth for "where we are."
#   - Help humans resume work instantly after context switches.
#   - Help AI agents align, plan, and reason without re-asking.
#
# Structure (Recommended):
#   - date_block:
#       timestamp: ISO-8601
#       summary:    One-sentence context
#       focus:      Current working area
#       next_steps: Short actionable list
#       notes:      Optional—decisions, changes, blockers

  summary: "Bundle lifecycle, project structure, and minimum SCDs documented. Validator Phase 1 complete (individual SCD validation). 13 implementation questions identified."
  focus: "Clarifying bundle structure, hierarchy, lifecycle, and validation strategy"
  completed_today:
    - "docs/bundle-lifecycle.md - Complete bundle lifecycle from DRAFT to VERSIONED, domain team workflow, change management"
    - "docs/project-structure.md - Recommended project directory structure with naming conventions, file organization, CI/CD integration"
    - "docs/minimum-project-scds.md - Minimum set of 38 project-tier SCDs across 10 domain bundles for production projects"
    - "SCD Validator Phase 1 - Fully functional CLI validator with syntax, schema, and semantic validation for individual SCDs"
    - "Validator testing - Tested with valid and invalid SCDs, both text and JSON output working"
    - ".gitignore created - Added .private directory for internal project notes"
    - ".private/bundle-implementation-questions.md - Identified 13 critical decisions needed for Phase 2"
    - ".private/project-tracker.md - Complete roadmap showing what's done, what's blocked, and next steps"
  current_state:
    documentation:
      - "Bundle concepts: lifecycle, hierarchy, DRAFT vs VERSIONED states documented"
      - "Project structure: complete conventions for bundles/, context/, file naming"
      - "Minimum SCDs: 10 domain bundles with 38 total project-tier SCDs defined"
    validator:
      - "Phase 1: Individual SCD validation complete and tested"
      - "Phase 2: Bundle validation blocked by 13 implementation questions"
    blockers:
      - "13 implementation decisions needed (see .private/bundle-implementation-questions.md)"
      - "High priority (3): Meta/standards listing, version references, DRAFT vs VERSIONED validation"
      - "Medium priority (3): Bundle independence, cross-bundle relationships, state tracking"
      - "Low priority (2): Import resolution, provenance updates"
      - "Clarifications (5): Validator next steps, meta-tier definitions, relationship types, content structure, standards examples"
  next_steps:
    immediate:
      - "Answer 13 implementation questions in .private/bundle-implementation-questions.md"
      - "Update spec documents with decisions"
      - "Update schemas based on decisions (e.g., state field, version references)"
    after_decisions:
      - "Build Validator Phase 2: bundle validation, relationship validation, import resolution"
      - "Create standard meta-tier SCDs (roles, capabilities, domains, concerns) if decided"
      - "Document relationship types specification if decided"
      - "Rebuild reference implementation with new project structure"
  notes: >
    Major clarity achieved on bundle structure and lifecycle. The hierarchical model (project bundle → domain bundles → SCDs)
    is now clearly documented. Project structure provides concrete conventions teams can follow.
    Validator Phase 1 is production-ready for individual SCD validation.
    Next phase requires architectural decisions on versioning, state tracking, and validation rules.
    All decisions tracked in .private/ with clear priorities and dependencies.
    Project tracker provides complete roadmap preventing loss of context.

  summary: "Major documentation push complete: VISION, GOVERNANCE, usage-guide, and validation-workflow finished. 4 of 7 Month 1 deliverables done."
  focus: "Completing Month 1 documentation for soft launch (per GO_TO_MARKET_PLAN.md)"
  completed_today:
    - "VISION.md - Comprehensive overview capturing full CEDM/SCS value proposition, indemnification argument, multi-AI coordination, autonomic everything"
    - "GOVERNANCE.md - Full governance model with Benevolent Maintainer phase, RFC process (inspired by Rust), version policy, IP/trademark protection"
    - "rfcs/ infrastructure - Created RFC template (0000-template.md) and README with process documentation"
    - "docs/usage-guide.md - Step-by-step guide: creating SCDs, building bundles, relationships, patterns, anti-patterns (complete tutorial)"
    - "docs/validation-workflow.md - 6 levels of validation, CI/CD integration, common errors, checklists, autonomic governance validation"
    - "GO_TO_MARKET_PLAN.md - Detailed 24-month plan with Hybrid Soft Launch strategy, week-by-week tasks, revenue projections"
  next_steps:
    - "Create 2-3 concrete example SCD bundles (healthcare API, e-commerce, internal tool) - Est: 12-15 hours"
    - "Build basic SCD validator tool (schema validation, relationship checking) - Est: 8-12 hours"
    - "Strengthen README.md with value propositions (lead with indemnification/compliance argument) - Est: 2-3 hours"
    - "After above: White paper development (extract from CEDM book + VISION.md) - Month 2"
  notes: >
    Significant progress toward Month 3 soft launch. Core documentation is now professional and complete.
    VISION.md establishes the "why" (AI without structured context is legally indefensible).
    GOVERNANCE.md provides professional open source governance.
    Usage and validation guides make SCS practical and usable.
    GO_TO_MARKET_PLAN.md provides clear roadmap from soft launch → consulting → platform.
    Remaining Month 1 work: examples, validator, README update (~22-30 hours total).
    Strategy confirmed: Open source spec/registry/tools, commercial platform/book/consulting.
    Protection: Trademark SCS/CEDM, be the authority, control registry, stay ahead on commercial tools.

  summary: "Repo split complete; beginning spec hardening toward Draft 0.1."
  focus: "Strengthen Structured Context Specification (Repo: structured-context-spec)"
  next_steps:
    - "Validate tier definitions and boundaries for meta-tier, project-tier, and standards-tier."
    - "Tighten the core model: SCD shape, bundle shape, category taxonomy, identity & references, versioning model, and intent↔SCD↔bundle link semantics."
    - "Rewrite bundle semantics (v0.2) so bundles reference spec version, list SCDs explicitly, define provenance, optionally reference registry artifacts, and include policy/constraint metadata."
    - "Revisit JSON schemas so required/optional fields and structures match the clarified spec wording and bundle definition."
    - "Clarify governance surfaces: describe governance checks, how governance agents operate, which SCDs they consume, and how teams interpret results."
    - "Produce a high-level Spec Overview diagram tying tiers, SCDs, bundles, registry, tools, and reference implementation together."
  notes: >
    Repo split into four repos (spec, registry, reference implementation, tools) is complete.
    Today’s focus is on stabilizing the core specification so it is usable by the team as Draft 0.1.
    Registry population and reference implementation refinement will follow after spec hardening.
