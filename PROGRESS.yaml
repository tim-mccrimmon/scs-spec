# SCS-Spec STATUS CONTEXT (Do Not Remove This Header)
# =====================================================================
# This file provides a machine-readable snapshot of the project's
# current state, priorities, and focus. It is updated continuously.
#
# Update Rules:
#   1. ALWAYS add new updates at the TOP of the file.
#   2. NEVER rewrite or reorder older entries—append downward.
#   3. Keep summaries concise, factual, and oriented to action.
#   4. Agents should treat the topmost block as authoritative.
#
# Purpose:
#   - Provide a single source of truth for "where we are."
#   - Help humans resume work instantly after context switches.
#   - Help AI agents align, plan, and reason without re-asking.
#
# Structure (Recommended):
#   - date_block:
#       timestamp: ISO-8601
#       summary:    One-sentence context
#       focus:      Current working area
#       next_steps: Short actionable list
#       notes:      Optional—decisions, changes, blockers

  summary: "Repo split complete; beginning spec hardening toward Draft 0.1."
  focus: "Strengthen Structured Context Specification (Repo: structured-context-spec)"
  next_steps:
    - "Validate tier definitions and boundaries for meta-tier, project-tier, and standards-tier."
    - "Tighten the core model: SCD shape, bundle shape, category taxonomy, identity & references, versioning model, and intent↔SCD↔bundle link semantics."
    - "Rewrite bundle semantics (v0.2) so bundles reference spec version, list SCDs explicitly, define provenance, optionally reference registry artifacts, and include policy/constraint metadata."
    - "Revisit JSON schemas so required/optional fields and structures match the clarified spec wording and bundle definition."
    - "Clarify governance surfaces: describe governance checks, how governance agents operate, which SCDs they consume, and how teams interpret results."
    - "Produce a high-level Spec Overview diagram tying tiers, SCDs, bundles, registry, tools, and reference implementation together."
  notes: >
    Repo split into four repos (spec, registry, reference implementation, tools) is complete.
    Today’s focus is on stabilizing the core specification so it is usable by the team as Draft 0.1.
    Registry population and reference implementation refinement will follow after spec hardening.
